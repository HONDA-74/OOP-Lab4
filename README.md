# 🧪 OOP Lab 4 – C++

This repository contains Lab 4 of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course using C++ as part of the ITI 9-Month Program.

## 📌 Lab Overview

Lab 4 introduces more advanced C++ programming techniques, preparing the transition toward deeper OOP concepts.
The lab focuses on recursion, pointer behavior, reference passing, console-based menus, and modern C++ features like std::span.

## 📝 What This Lab Covers

According to main.cpp, this lab includes:

Building an interactive console menu system using arrow keys and escape sequences

Managing structured data using a custom Employee struct

Practicing recursion through:

Fibonacci sequence generation

Converting integers to binary representation

Applying pass-by-reference in swap operations

Working with C++ arrays and std::array

Introducing std::span to safely manipulate array slices without copying

Splitting arrays into multiple sections and modifying each part independently

Enhancing console UI using system("cls"), cursor movement, and formatted output

This lab builds practical skills that combine logic, recursion, memory handling, and user interaction — all essential before fully applying object-oriented design principles.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing Lab 4, you will:

Strengthen your understanding of recursion and reference semantics

Learn how to build interactive console applications

Practice working with arrays and modern C++ features (std::span)

Improve code clarity through function-based modular design

Prepare for upcoming OOP topics (encapsulation, classes, methods, etc.)
